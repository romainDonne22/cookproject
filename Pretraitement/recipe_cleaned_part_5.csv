regardless of its exact origin, zabaglione's roots are planted in italian food history. zabaglione evolved as a delicacy that eventually became popular in france, where it is known as sabayon.

zabaglione or sabayon is a delicate sauce of foamed egg yolks, sugar, and wine. (marsala is traditional in the italian version, and champagne or dry white wine is preferred in the french version.) the yolks are whipped vigorously as they cook over simmering water until a dense, thick foam develops. whipping allows the incorporation of air, which creates a foam. 
the following recipe for zabaglione with fresh berries has been adapted from the culinary institute of america's baking and pastry, mastering the art and craft.note: if desired, whip 6 fl oz of heavy cream to medium peaks and fold into cooled

zucchinis are rich in calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, beta-carotene, vitamin b-complex, vitamin c, vitamin a and vitamin k. they are very low calorie vegetables. zucchinis skin is an excellent source of dietary fiber and offers some protection against colon cancers.
unlike corn, fresh corn kernels have fewer calories and contain no gluten. yellow corn kernels contain high levels of b complex, vitamin a, lutin, flavonoids among other important nutrients, and contain a moderate amount of minerals such as zinc, magnesium, copper, iron and manganese. however, corn, in line with rice, potato, etc., is one of the high glycemic index foods, limiting its authority to the main food ingredient in diabetic patients. for more information go to www.nutrition-and-you.com.

number of servings depends on your garden!  herbs can be dry or fresh; use what you like!  prep time depends on how long it takes to pick the flowers.  be sure there are no little critters in the flowers.  the cheese can be boursin or rondele'.  i'm going to try goat cheese this year. it is kind of a fiddly recipe.  but it's so pretty.  and it really doesn't take that long!  this lends itself to all sorts of substitutes for cheese, vinaigrette and herbs, just whatever you like.

to make the tots, i mix shredded zucchini with some minced shallot and dried spices and bind it all together with an egg, breadcrumbs and yummy cheese. i like to use italian spices and a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheese and serve the tots with marinara sauce for dipping. but what i love about this recipe is that it's a blank slate and you can use whatever types of seasoning and cheese you like. they would also be delicious with cheddar or monterey jack cheese, dipped in a healthy ranch style sauce.

just be sure to wring out as much water from the zucchini as you can. zucchini has a high water content so this step is important to prevent the tots from getting soggy. after forming the mixture into tater tot shapes, simply spray them with olive oil and pop them in the oven. after about 20 minutes, they'll be puffed up and ready to be devoured!","['zucchini', 'shallots', 'mozzarella cheese', 'parmesan cheese', 'whole wheat panko', 'egg', 'dried italian seasoning', 'garlic powder', 'kosher salt', 'olive oil', 'marinara sauce']",11,38.2,3.0,2.0,6.0,5.0,5.0,0.0,2016,8,31,Wednesday

update, 13-8-07: decided to try and use 4 cups flour to get a fatter loaf. it worked, and with the same smallish pot i got a lovely loaf. this 2nd recipe is tacked on to the instruction list. good luck!

by the way, if you want wholewheat bread, don't use this recipe. rather use your bread machine or your normal way of bread-making. this very french-style loaf should be made from white bread flour, and you can add in a little fine rye flour. sometimes i add 1 cup of ""brown bread grain flour"" which is very finely stone-milled, and has no large bran flakes. but basically, this is a white bread. go on, indulge! slice a piece for yourself when you can handle it and the crust is still crunchy-hard ... heaven!","['white bread flour', 'instant yeast', 'sugar', 'salt', 'water']",5,1379.6,5.0,12.0,194.0,79.0,3.0,96.0,2006,11,18,Saturday
